/**
 * Description:		A KingCrab gets the actors to be processed in the
 * 	same way a CrabCritter does. A KingCrab causes each actor that it
 * 	processes to move one location further away from the KingCrab. If
 * 	the actor cannot move away, the KingCrab removes it from the grid.
 * 	When the KingCrab has completed processing the actors, it moves like
 * 	a CrabCritter.
