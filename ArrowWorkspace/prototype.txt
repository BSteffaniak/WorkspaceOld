Dear Mr. and Mrs.

	My name is Braden Steffaniak from Metro Community Church. The reason I am not calling you is because
I hate talking on the phone. Anyway, I would like to know if you would be kind enough to support me with
STRIVE. STRIVE stands for Students Turning Responsibility Into Valuable Experiences. If you could sponsor
me for any amount of money ($10, $20, etc.) it would help me out immensely. The Metro Community Church
Youth will have a STRIVE work-day and help out several places in the community. Some include the hospice
home, humane shelter, the Childrens Museum, and others too. To sponsor me you can notify me by replying to
this email and turn the money in at Metro Community Church throughout the following weeks.

Thanks you for your time,
Braden

If you have any questions you can reply to this message.
